# Role Tags/Icons in Discord Chat

## 🎨 How Roles Show in Chat

### 1. **Role Colors** (Already Working!)
- ✅ Username color changes based on role
- ✅ Works automatically if role has a color
- ✅ No Server Boost needed

### 2. **Role Icons** (Requires Server Boost Level 2)
- ⚠️ Shows emoji/image next to username
- ⚠️ Requires Server Boost Level 2
- ⚠️ Can use emoji or custom image

## 🔍 Check Current Setup

Your roles should already show colors in chat. To verify:

1. Open Discord → Your server
2. Look at any message from a user with a role
3. Their username should be colored based on their role:
   - 👤 Citizen = Light Gray
   - ⚔️ Knight = Blue
   - 🔨 Mod = Red
   - ⭐ Admin = Purple

## 🎯 If Colors Aren't Showing

### Make Sure Roles Are "Hoisted":
1. Server Settings → Roles
2. Find the role (e.g., "⭐ Admin")
3. Make sure "Display role members separately from online members" is ON
4. This is already set in our script, but verify it's enabled

### Check Role Position:
- Roles need to be above @everyone
- Our script already sets this correctly

2. Click on a role (e.g., "⭐ Admin")
3. Scroll to "Role Icon"
4. Click "Set Icon"
5. Choose an emoji or upload an image
6. Save

### Option 2: Using Custom Images
1. Server Settings → Roles
2. Click on a role
3. Scroll to "Role Icon"
4. Upload a custom image (64x64px recommended)
5. Save
