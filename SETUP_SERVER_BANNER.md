## Tips

**For Animated GIFs:**
- Keep file size reasonable (under 5MB recommended)
- Shorter loops work better
- Test the GIF before uploading

**For Static Images:**
- High quality PNG works best
- Can use JPG if file size is an issue

**Banner Visibility:**
- Shows at the top of your server for all members
- Only visible if server has at least Level 1 boost
- Can be changed anytime in Server Settings

## Troubleshooting

**"Upload Banner" button is grayed out:**
- Your server needs at least Level 1 boost
- Check Server Settings → Server Boost Status

**Banner doesn't animate:**
- Make sure you uploaded a GIF file (not just renamed PNG)
- Server needs Level 2 boost for animated banners
- Check file extension is `.gif`

**Banner looks stretched/cropped:**
- Ensure your image is exactly 960x540 pixels
- Use 16:9 aspect ratio
- Discord will crop if dimensions don't match

**File too large:**
- Compress the GIF/image
- Use tools like https://ezgif.com/optimize (for GIFs)
- Reduce quality slightly if needed
