# 🎫 Ticket Tool Multi-Button Panel Setup

## ✅ Correct Commands

You're right - Ticket Tool uses `/setup` not `/panel create`.

---

## 🎯 How to Create Multi-Button Panel

### Step 1: Use `/setup` Command

Type in Discord:
```
/setup
```

### Step 2: Configure Panel Options

Ticket Tool's `/setup` command lets you configure:
- Panel name
- Channel
- **Multiple ticket types/buttons**

---

## 🔧 Alternative: Configure via Dashboard

1. Go to: https://tickettool.xyz/dashboard/1449896304665821474/configs#pc-menu
2. Login with Discord
3. Look for **"Panel Configuration"** or **"Ticket Types"**
4. Add multiple ticket types/buttons to ONE panel

---

## 💡 What You Need

Ticket Tool supports multiple **ticket types** in one panel, not multiple separate panels.

When you run `/setup`, you should be able to:
- Add multiple ticket categories/types
- Each type becomes a button
- All buttons appear in ONE panel message

---

## 🆘 If `/setup` Only Shows One Button

You might need to:
1. Use the **web dashboard** to configure multiple ticket types
2. Or create multiple panels (Panel 1, Panel 2) and post them together
3. Or check Ticket Tool's premium features (some features require premium)

---

**Try `/setup` and see what options it gives you for multiple ticket types!**
